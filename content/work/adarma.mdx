# Context
Adarma provides managed security services. The challenge was to turn fragmented posture & incident data into a clear, actionable dashboard for executives and SOC teams.

# Problem
Leaders struggled with raw technical reports that weren’t decision-friendly. SOC analysts had no unified view.

# Outcomes
- Reduced time to insight for execs by ~40%
- Unified 3 data sources into one posture view
- Introduced reusable visualization patterns for SOC workflows

# Role & Team
- **My role:** Lead Product Designer (UX, UI, facilitation)  
- **Team:** PM, BA, 4 engineers, security SMEs  
- **Timeline:** 6 months  

# Process
1. Discovery (stakeholder interviews, mapped SOC workflows, reviewed raw telemetry)  
2. Information architecture (entity relationships and posture categories)  
3. Interaction & visualization (dashboards, severity states, drill-downs)  
4. Design system (tokens, charts, empty/error/loading patterns)  
5. Validation (usability tests with execs and SOC analysts)  
6. Delivery (specs, pairing with devs, QA)
